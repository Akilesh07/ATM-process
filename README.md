Customer Bank details and ATM process

This is a menu driven program with the following specifications
1. Load Cash to ATM  //only for admins
2. Show Customer Details //only for admins
3. Handle ATM Operations  //for users
      i) Check balance
      ii) Withdraw money
      iii)Transfer money
4. Check ATM balance  // for users

I have written the algorithm for denomination of notes to 
satisfy all the primary conditions. However, it will work for 
all conditions as the improper combination of notes is not 
gonna allow the user to withdraw money.

NOTE:
I am unable to include file handling within the allotted time. 
I have used the console i/p and o/p for the user interaction.
Shall include file handling operations in a day or two positively.
