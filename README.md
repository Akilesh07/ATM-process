I have written the algorithm for denomination of notes to 
satisfy all the primary conditions. However, it will work for 
all conditions as the improper combination of notes is not 
gonna allow the user to withdraw money.

PROJECT STATUS:
In progress. I have used the console i/p and o/p for the user interaction.
Shall include file handling operations in a day or two positively.
